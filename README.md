===

Laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web and mobile development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

This project is based on Thoughtbot's laptop script available [here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop).

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agendrix/laptop/master/mac
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```
